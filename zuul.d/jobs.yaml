      This is a base job for all jobs building Contrail artifacts.

      This job is a cornerstone for all the jobs that build Contrail
      artifacts (packages, docker containers) based on the monolithic
      build directory structure. It takes care of moving repositories
      checked out by zuul into their expected locations, as well
      as launching the build container.
